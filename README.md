Automatic control of an Airplane tack
=========================

In this project, developed within the exam of "control systems technology", we designed an automatic discrete controller for handling the airplane tacking. In addition to that we wanted to do a comparison between the manual and the automatic control. For the manual control we used as input command both an Arduino board and a simple joystick.
